# Express vs Node Server Comparison

## Preference:

Express

## Reason:

The syntax for Express is cleaner to read for spinning up a server with conditions. There is no if-else statement with various options to declare.Unlike with Node,the results do not need to be stringified because Express is doing that under the hood. The try and catch statement has cleaner syntax that makes it easier to read when comparing them side by side for a user's server. Specifically when looking at the error handling.
